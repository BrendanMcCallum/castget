.TH CASTGETRC "5" "July 2006" "@PACKAGE_STRING@" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
castgetrc \- configuration file for castget
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The configuration file \fB.castgetrc\fR located in a user's home directory defines the channels known to the RSS enclosure downloader \fBcastget\fR.
.PP
A simple key-value format is used. This consists of channel definitions for each RSS feed that you want \fBcastget\fR to process. Each channel definition is started by a line containing a user defined channel identifier enclosed in brackets. Following this are one or more key-value pairs on the form \fBkey=value\fR. A channel definition ends by the start of another channel definition or the end of the file.
.PP
Lines beginning with a hash character (`#') and blank lines are considered comments. All identifiers, keys and values should be UTF-8 encoded.
.PP
Key-value pairs in a channel definition define the behaviour of \fBcastget\fR when processing the channel. The channel definition
.PP
  [df]
  url=http://digitalflotsam.org/rss.xml
  spool=/home/joe/podcasts
.PP
for example, instructs \fBcastget\fR to use \fB/home/joe/podcasts\fR as a download directory when processing the channel \fBdf\fR.
