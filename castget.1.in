.SH NAME
castget \- download RSS enclosures
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B castget
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fICHANNEL IDENTIFIER\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The program downloads RSS enclosures, for example podcasts, from RSS feeds.
.TP
RSS feeds are assigned channel identifiers in the configuration file \fB.castgetrc\fR. Channels to be processed by \fBcastget\fR are indicated by supplying the channel identifiers as arguments. If no channel identifiers are provided, all available channels are processed.
.TP
If run without any options, \fBcastget\fR will perform the default action on all channels to be processed. The default action is to download any enclosure not already downloaded. Other actions may be performed by supplying one or more options as arguments.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS Operations
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-catchup\fR
catch up with channels and exit
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-list\fR

.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
display help and exit
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.SS Operation filters
.TP
\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-new-only\fR
restrict operation to new channels only, i.e. to channels that have never been
downloaded from or been caught up with before. Note that if a channel is added
to the configuration and subsequently removed, its download history is
preserved. This means that a channel that has been removed from the
configuration file will not be considered as `new' if it is added to the
configuration again at a later time.
.TP
\fB\-1\fR, \fB\-\-first-only\fR
restrict operation to the most recent item in each channel only.
.TP
\fB\-f\fR pattern, \fB\-\-filter=pattern\fR
restrict operation to items whose enclosures have names matching the
regular expression \fBpattern\fR. Note that this will override any
regular expression filters given in the configuration file.
