.SH SYNOPSIS
.B castget 
[\fIOPTION\fR]... [\fICHANNEL IDENTIFIER\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The program downloads RSS enclosures, for example podcasts, from RSS feeds.
.TP
RSS feeds are assigned channel identifiers in the configuration file \fB.castgetrc\fR. Channels to be processed by \fBcastget\fR are indicated by supplying the channel identifiers as arguments. If no channel identifiers are provided, all available channels are processed. 
.TP
If run without any options, \fBcastget\fR will perform the default action on all channels to be processed. The default action is to download any enclosure not already downloaded. Other actions may be performed by supplying one or more options as arguments.

\fB\-n\fR, \fB\-\-new-only\fR
operate on new channels only, i.e. on channels that have never been downloaded from or been caught up with before.
